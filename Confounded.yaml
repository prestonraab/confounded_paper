      Illustration of tool descriptions for printing simple greetings.
    caption: |
      In the examples associated with this article, we provide tool descriptions that illustrate how to print custom greetings at the command line. These diagrams illustrate the `02_hello.cwl` (**A**) and `03_hello.cwl` (**B**) examples. In **A**, the tool description indicates which inputs that must be specified, along with a template for executing the command; it also indicates that a message will be printed to standard output and that this message should be stored in a file called `02_output.txt`. The `hello_objects_age.yml` input-object file stores values for a particular invocation of the tool. In **A**, the `cwltool` workflow engine uses the host computer's operating system to execute the tool; thus the echo command must be supported on that operating system. In **B**, the tool description defines a software container environment; thus `cwltool` executes the command within a container, which provides the echo command (packaged with the Debian Linux operating system).
